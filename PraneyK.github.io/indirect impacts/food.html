<h2>Food security, undernutrition and food prices</h2>

    <p>
        It is difficult to project the impact of climate change on utilization (protecting food against spoilage, being healthy enough to absorb nutrients, etc.) and on volatility of food prices. Most models projecting the future do indicate that prices will become more volatile. In 2019 the IPCC stated that millions already suffer from food insecurity due to climate change. As of 2019, an estimated 831 million people are undernourished. Climate change impacts depend strongly on projected future social and economic development.

A study in 2019 showed that climate change has already increased the risk of food insecurity in many food insecure countries.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 found that: "Climate change will increase loss of years of full health by 10% in 2050 under RCP8.5 due to undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies (medium evidence, high agreement).
