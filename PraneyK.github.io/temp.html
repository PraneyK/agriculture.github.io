<h2>Rising in temperatures</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>As the temperature and weather patterns change, areas suitable for farming will alter. The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major arid and semi-arid regions (Middle East, Africa, Australia, Southwest United States, and Southern Europe). In addition, crop yields in tropical regions will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2 °C) expected to occur during the first half of the century. During the second half of the century, further warming is projected to decrease crop yields in all regions including Canada and the Northern United States. Many staple crops are extremely sensitive to heat and when temperatures rise over 36 °C, soybean seedlings are killed and corn pollen loses its vitality.

  Higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in some regions would result in a longer growing season there. For example, a 2014 study found that maize yields in the Heilongjiang region of China had increased by between 7 and 17% per decade as a result of rising temperatures.</p>
