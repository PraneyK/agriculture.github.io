<h2>Heat Waves</h2>

<div class="box">
  <p>In the summer of 2018, heat waves probably linked to climate change greatly reduced average yield in many parts of the world, especially Europe. Depending on conditions during August, more crop failures could rise global food prices. Losses are comparable to those of 1945, the worst harvest in memory. 2018 was the third time in four years that global wheat, rice and maize production failed to meet demand, forcing governments and food companies to release stocks from storage.</p>
