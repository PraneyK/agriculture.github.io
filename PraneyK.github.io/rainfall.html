<h2>Change in Rainfall</h2>\

<div class="box">
    <p class="a">Droughts and floods contribute to decreases crop yields due to climate change, extreme weather events become more common. In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupt agricultural activities and render workers jobless and eliminate food supply. Droughts can also wipe out crops. Drought in developing countries exacerbates pre-existing poverty and fosters famine and malnutrition.</p>
       <p class="b">  Irrigation of crops is able to reduce or even remove the impacts on yields of lower rainfall and higher temperatures - through localised cooling.  However, using water resources for irrigation has downsides and is expensive. Also, the water must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for a long time, the rivers may be dry and the irrigation water would have to be transported from further distances.</p>
        
       <p class="c"> Droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand, population growth, urban expansion in many areas. Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock. Some farmers may choose to permanently stop farming a drought-affected area and go elsewhere.</p>
        
       <p class="d"> At the beginning of the 21st century, floods probably linked to climate change shortened the planting season in the Midwest region in United States, causing damage to the agriculture sector. In May 2019 the floods reduced the projected corn yield from 15 billion bushels to 14.2.</p>
